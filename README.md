## Java Application Design

The Food Ordering System is developed using Java programming language. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the ordering functionalities. The application securely manages user profiles and transactions.

1. Restaurant: Contains information about registered restaurants and cafes, such as name, address, and contact details.

2. Menu: Stores the menu items offered by each restaurant, including food names, prices, and descriptions.

3. User Profile: Keeps track of user profiles, delivery addresses, and order history.

4. Orders: Records details of each placed order, including order ID, user ID, restaurant ID, and order status.
